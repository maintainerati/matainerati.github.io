## Definitions

## 1. Data protection principles

The Project is committed to processing data in accordance with its responsibilities under the GDPR.
// The GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) outlines six data protection principles that summarise its many requirements.

These are an essential resources for those trying to understanding how to achieve compliance. Indeed, small organisations, which often lack the resources to appoint data protection experts to guide them through compliance, may find them particularly useful.
 let us have  a look at each one of the following here 
 1.  Lawfulness, fairness and transparency
 2.  Purpose limitation
 3. Data minimisation
 4.  Accuracy
 5.  Storage limitation
 6.  Integrity and confidentiality



Article 5 of the GDPR requires that personal data shall be:

1. processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner in relation to individuals;

2. collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes; further processing for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes shall not be considered to be incompatible with the initial purposes;

3. adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed;

4. accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date; every reasonable step must be taken to ensure that personal data that are inaccurate, having regard to the purposes for which they are processed, are erased or rectified without delay;

5. kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data are processed; personal data may be stored for longer periods insofar as the personal data will be processed solely for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes subject to implementation of the appropriate technical and organisational measures required by the GDPR in order to safeguard the rights and freedoms of individuals; and

6. processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using appropriate technical or organisational measures.”

2. The Responsible Person shall take responsibility for the Project’s ongoing compliance with this policy.

3. This policy shall be reviewed at least annually.

4. The Project shall register with the Information Commissioner’s Office as an organisation that processes personal data.

## 3. Lawful, fair and transparent processing

3. Individuals have the right to access their personal data and any such requests made to the project shall be dealt with in a timely manner.

## 4. Lawful purposes

1. All data processed by the project must be done on one of the following lawful bases: consent, contract, legal obligation, vital interests, public task or legitimate interests (see ICO guidance for more information).

2. The Project shall note the appropriate lawful basis in the Register of Systems.

3. Where consent is relied upon as a lawful basis for processing data, evidence of opt-in consent shall be kept with the personal data.

4. Where communications are sent to individuals based on their consent, the option for the individual to revoke their consent should be clearly available and systems should be in place to ensure such revocation is reflected accurately in the Project’s systems.

1. To ensure that personal data is kept for no longer than necessary, the Project shall put in place an archiving policy for each area in which personal data is processed and review this process annually.

2. The archiving policy shall consider what data should/must be retained, for how long, and why.

## 8. Security

1. The Project shall ensure that personal data is stored securely using modern software that is kept up-to-date.

2. Access to personal data shall be limited to personnel who need access and appropriate security should be in place to avoid unauthorised sharing of information.

3. When personal data is deleted this should be done safely such that the data is irrecoverable.

4. Appropriate back-up and disaster recovery solutions shall be in place.

## 9. Breach
